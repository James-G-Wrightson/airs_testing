## **ABSTRACT**

*Many utility companies offer their customers the choice ofparticipution in an averagepayment plan, which enables them to pay a fixed sum for their utility bill each month (with fir&settlemen& at the end of the b~iI~ng year), ~nsteud of the c#nver~t~~na~ "pay as you go" billing procedure. Because customers on average payment plans are protectedfrom paying large bi#s during peak energy-use seasons and because the inf~rn~at~on about month fy energy use and its cost &perhaps fess saIienf to them, it was hypothesized that customers on the averagepayment~~a~ would use m@re electricity than customers not on the plan. Using a n~ne~~~va~ent c~ntr~~gr~M~ design, the electricity consumption of a seiection of customers of two utility companies (Ns =*  475 *and* 74) *was examined. The results showed that there was no evidence to support the hypothesis. Since the iogic* af hypothesis *testing does not permit the read-v acceptante of the nuN hypothesis, severalprocedura~, rneth~dQ~~g~ca~, andstatistica~points were made to buttress the c~ncfusi~n that the average payment plans had no effect on electricity consumption.* 

In this era of high energy costs many utility companies have instituted what they call "average payment,'" "budget," or "equal monthly payment" plans to soften the impact of large bills. These plans are offered so that payment for household energy for months of peak usage can be spread out over a longer time. There are several variations on these fixed monthly payment plans, but typically they work as follows: The utility company estimates the total yearly cost of energy for a particular household and divides that total by twelve to arrive at the fixed monthly payment over the course of a year. At the end of the year, customers settle up with the

company for any discrepancy between their actual energy costs and their payments.

It appears that there is a great deal of satisfaction with these plans among both utility company executives and the customers who use them. Some utility company executives report that the number of complaints over high bills, "faulty meters," and rising rates dropped precipitously after customers came on the plan. More companies throughout the country are adopting them and the number of people in existing plans is increasing rapidly. In some areas, the number of families on an average payment plan has climbed to nearly 45% of

totat customers ~Consumers Flock to Year-Round Budget Plans," 1979). Enrollment figures suggest that once customers are on such plans very few quit them.

Although energy conservation was not a pertinent concern to the institution of average payment plans, the plans may have an unintended impact on energy consumption, There are several reasons for suspecting that customers on an average payment plan may consume more household energy than customers not on the plan. First, the financial consequences of consumption are less direct under an average payment plan. Indeed, from an energy conservation perspective, it is precisely during those periods of peak energy consumption that one would want the restraining influence of high energy costs to have an impact. Spreading the high energy costs of a few months over many months is likely to weaken the influence of the price of energy on consumption. Second, customers on the average payment plan may pay less attention to the information listed on their monthly energy bills. Customers on budget plans receive the same information about energy usage and its cost as other customers, but because they pay a fixed sum each month this information may be less important or sdient to them. Feedback about energy use, however, frequently has been found to help people reduce their household energy consumption (e.g., Becker, 1978; Seligman & Darley, 1977; Winett & Neale, 1979). To the extent that the monthly feedback provided by utility bills can facilitate conservation, i~~~te~~ion to such feedback may lead to more energy use than if the feedback were heeded.

A dramatic example of the size of excessive energy consumption that may arise from fack of both information about and direct financial responsibility for energy use comes from research on m~st~r-metered apartment buildings, i.e., buildings in which only one utility meter registers the consumption in all households. Residents in such buildings have their energy costs included in their fixed rent and so receive no periodic utility bill informing them of the amount and cost of their energy consumption. McClelland (Note 1) concluded that residents of master-metered buildings use IO-25@10 more energy than residents of individually-metered apartments.

The best way to determine the effect of average payment plans per se on energy consumption would be to assign customers randomly to average pa~e~t and conventional payment plans. Randomization would remove the likely confound of subjects' self-selection into the plans. Unfortunately, we were unable to convince the officials of the utility companies we contacted to allow us to assign customers at random to plans (cf., Boruch, 1976). They feared that the customers who were assigned to the control group would feel inconvenienced. Also, they were concerned about adding to their own bookkeeping and administrative responsibilities. However, given the voluntary nattire of almost all participation in average payment plans, the important practical question is not whether the plans per se affect energy consumption but whether they affect the energy consumption of those who ask to go on (and do go on) the plans compared to those who do not ask (and do not go on), To address this question, the plans of two utility companies were evaluated: the Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO), Washington, D-C. and the Commonwealth Edison Company (CECO), Chicago, Illinois. Their pfans are typical of many in the country.

#### **METHOD**

#### **Design**

The nonequivalent, untreated cantrol group design with pretest and posttest (see Cook & Campbell, 1979) was used. In this design, the electricity consumption of customers on the average payment plan (treatment condition} and of customers on the conventional "pay as you go" plan (control condition) was examined far two periods, one before and one after the experimental customers went on the average payment plan. If the present hypothesis about the effect of average payment plans on electric consumption were correct, then: (1) in the cases when the control group increased its consumption from pretest to posttest or remained stable, the treatment group would increase its consun~~t~~~ from pretest to posttest more than the control, and (2) in the case when the control group decreased its consumption from pretest to posttest, the treatment group would decrease its consumption less than the control group. In other words, it was predicted that the treatment group

would co~surn~ more energy or conserve less energy than the control group from pretest to posttest. A statistically significant interaction between group and time showing any of the above patterns of results would support the hypothesis.

Clearly, in the present design the similarity of the treatment and control groups is critical; the greater the similarity, the more effective the control. With this in mind, an attempt was made to choose control group members on a basis that would increase the likelihood of similarity with treatment group households. Rather than sampling r~ndo~lly from households not cm the average payment plan, it was possible in the PEPCO study to select the neighbors of households on the plan as subjects for the control group. In the CECO study, the first appropriate household not on the plan folIowing a treatment household in the company's billing records was chosen as a control. This was often a next

door neighbor and always a household in the same neighborhood.

The summers of 1975 and 1976 were chosen as the pretest and posttest periods for several reasons. Summer electricity consumption, mainly because of the relatively large energy requirements of air conditioners, has the greatest discretionary component of any type of energy consumption in any season. If the discretionary uses of energy are those that are most easily modified, as indeed seems to be the case, then summer electricity consumption should be the focus, especially since the effect of an average payment plan was not expected to be large. Summer was chosen for both the pretest and posttest periods to minimize the problem of consumption differences across different seasons. Seasonal consumption rather than monthly consumption was examined because of its greater reliability. Summer is a time when many people take vacations, and this can adversely affect the reliability of monthly consumption data. The two particular summers examined were chosen in part because they were the most recent to the time the studies were conducted. This meant that most of the needed information was still on the utility companies' computer files, a fact that greatly facilitated subject selection. Also, these two summers were highly comparable in terms of temperature. (The summer of 1976 was a little cooler in both the Washington, D.C., and Chicago areas.) According to National Weather Service records, they were the most similar adjacent summers of any in at least the preceding five years.

#### **PEPCO Study**

A search of PEPCO's computer files identified 221 residential customers (excluding apartment dwellers) who (1) lived in their homes at the beginning of the summer of 1975, **(2)** came on the plan sometime between the summers of 1975 and 1976 (i.e., between October 1, 1975 and May 31, 1976), and (3) remained on the plan through the summer of 1976. Consumption records were obtained for these households as well as for their next door neighbors on each side. However, plan households were sometimes next door to each other, so adjacent households could not be used as controls. Neighbors whose annual usage was less than \$240 were

also not used as controls because PEPCO's average payment plan is not open to them. Other next door neighbors that could not be used as controls were small commercial establishments, apartment buildings, new houses not completed in the summer of 1975, and houses whose ownership changed between the summers of 1975 and 1976. The final sample consisted of 90 treatment households that had both next door neighbors suitable as control households, 74 that had one neighbor suitable as a control, and 57 with no neighbors acceptable as control households. Thus the study involved 221 households who asked to be enrolled (and were enrolled) on the plan and 254 control households.

#### CECO **Study**

The PEPCO computer search for appropriate treatment households checked all the customers in their service area. The number of customers in the CECO service area is more than five times as great (roughly 2.7 million versus .5 million). Because of the costs involved in identifying and obtaining the consumption records for every eligible treatment household and control, discussions with CECO executives resulted in some constraints being placed on the computer search. Only residential electric space heating accounts were checked. Three hundred such customers (including apartment dwellers) were randomly selected from among those who came on the plan between January 1, 1976 and May 3 1,1976. (When the computer search was made, the records for early months had been purged from the computer files.) Printed out along with each selected treatment household was the next customer listed in the records as not having come on the plan during this time. These customers were to serve as the controls. When the consumption records for all households were examined, it was found that most of those who had come on the plan did so soon after moving into their homes. This meant, unfortunately, that there was no record of summer 1975 consumption for them, and they had to be dropped. Some subjects were also lost because they moved before the end of the summer of 1976. The final sample consisted of 42 treatment households that had 32 acceptable control households.

### **RESULTS**

When was analyzed using 2 x 2 repeated measure analysis of selection into conditions is based on group differences, variance in which group (treatment and control) was such as volunteerism in the present case, and when crossed with year (1975 and 1976), the repeated variance is stable over time, then a raw change score measure. Table 1 presents the cell means and standard analysis is recommended by Kenny. The main effect of deviations for the PEPCO data, and Table 2 presents group in this type of analysis is equivalent to the group- that information for the CECO data.

There are several ways to analyze the data from non- analysis of variance (Huck & McLean, 1975). In the

Thus, there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that average payment plans affect energy consumption. There were significant main effects, though, for groups and year. In the PEPCO study, customers who asked to be put on the average payment plan used significantly more electricity (48.92 kWh versus 41.51 kWh, or 17.9% more) over both years than their neighbors, Ff1,473) = 20.78, p< .OOl, R\* = .04. There was also a sizeabIe difference of the same sort

between groups in the CECO study (41.74 kWh versus 36.52 kWh, or 14.3% more consumption in the treatment group), but this difference was not statistically significant. The difference in consumption across years was significant in both studies, F (1,473) = 16.62, p < .OOl, *R2 =* .002 in the PEPCO study, and *F(l,72) = 7.46, p <.008, R\* = .002* in the CECO study. This reflected the fact that the summer of 1975 was warmer than the summer of 1976 and so more electricity was required for air conditioning.

#### **DISCUSSION**

The results of the present studies suggest that average that it is true. Accordingly, average payment plans payment plans, as they are now instituted, do not affect should be continued because of their benefits and residential energy consumption. Following Cook and because there is no evidence at present that they Campbell (1979), it is appropriate for utility company adversely affect energy consumption. However, officials, on the basis of these results, to act as though average payment plans that are vastly different from the null hypothesis were true but not as if they "know" the PEPCO and CECO plans may affect energy con-

that it is truc. Accordingly, average payment plans
should be continued because of their benefits and
because there is no evidence at present that they
adversely affect energy consumption. However,
average payment plans that are vastly different from
the PEPCO and CECO plans may affect energy con-

sumption, and there may also exist other unintended, negative consequences that have not been discovered.

To increase confidence in a finding in favor of the null hypothesis requires demonstrating that the test was adequately conducted and the data properly analyzed (Cook, Cruder, Hennigan, & Flay, 1979; Greenwald, 1975). Several points can be offered to buttress the conclusion that the average payment plans did not affect energy use. First, the data of both studies present virtually the same picture. In each study the treatment group always used considerably more electricity than the control group, and more electricity was used by each group in the summer of 1975 than in the summer of 1976. More directly relevant to the matter of the treatment effect, in both studies there was little difference in how the electricity consumption of the two groups changed from one summer to the next, and in neither study was the interaction statistically significant. Second, in the present studies the test for the interaction effect was quite powerful. In the PEPCO study, given the total variance in consumption, the within-subject error (i.e., subject-by-year variance), and an a = .05, an interaction effect accounting for 1% of the variance would have had a .50 probability of being detected as significant with a sample size of 20 (that is, 20 cases in each group) and a .80 probability with a sample size of 39. In the CECO study the same effect size would have a .50 probability of being detected as significant with a sample size of 10 and .80 probability with a sample size of 19. Since more subjects were actually used in the studies, even smaller effects could have been detected. In the CECO study an interaction effect accounting for as little as .13% of the variance would have been found to be significant. In the PEPCO study an even smaller interaction effect would have been detected, one accounting for just .04010 of the variance. This power derived from the design of the studies, a repeated measures design, and from the sizes of the samples, particularly large in the case of the PEPCO study. Third, as stated earlier, the decision to use summer electricity consumption as the dependent variable also should have maximized the chance to find a treatment effect, since there is considerable discretionary energy use in the summer. Fourth, unlike the case of most evatuation studies (cf. Boruch & Gomez, 1977), there need be little concern about the proper implementation of the treatment, since it was a simple procedure involving billing statements. Also, measurement reliability was probably exceedingly high, **since** the electric meters were read by professional meter readers, enough points were taken so that the data could be screened for unusual readings (possibly signifying errors), and each data point in the analysis consisted of several monthly readings.

The reasons for initially suspecting that average payment plans might have an impact on energy consumption need to be re-examined in light of the present findings. It was thought that by leveling costs, average payment plans might remove the restraining influence of several large monthly bills. However, it may be that consumers are no more sensitive to the impact of several large monthly bills during the year than they are to the overall yearly financial consequences of consumption. Also considered was the possibility that the information on utility bills would receive less attention from customers on average payment plans and that whatever dampening effect this feedback might have would be lost. (It should be remembered that average payment plans bills typically contain all the information present on conventional plan bills.) The lack of an effect of the average payment plans on consumption may be indicating that average payment plan customers pay no less attention to information on their utility bills than "pay as you go" customers. A recent survey of welleducated, middle-class homeowners on conventional billing plans showed that they do not have a good idea of how much energy they use in their homes, how much they pay for it, or how much various appliances contribute to total consumption (Becker, Seligman, & Darley, Note 2). Thus, general knowledge of and attention to matters of energy use may be so low that an average payment plan could not lower it further. The lack of an average payment plan effect could also be an indication that the monthly feedback provided by utility bill information is not an effective aid to residents' conservation efforts. Utility bill information does not provide the kind of feedback shown by experiments to facilitate conservation, and it is not given nearly as frequently (namety several times a week) as in those successful experiments (cf., Seligman, Becker, & Dartey, in press).

In the present studies, the interactions, with p levels greater than .lO, were not statistically significant according to the conventional criterion. But suppose the p levels were between .05 and . lo? Should one be as willing to conclude that average payment plans do not adversely affect energy conservation? The issue is more than a statistical matter involving the arbitrary convention of placing the alpha level at 5%. The value of continuing the program must be contrasted with the value of not continuing the program (see Crane, 1976). As the current debate over the wisdom of nuclear power makes clear, these are not easy decisions to make. The relative size of Type 1 and Type 2 errors is only one among a host of methodological, social, economic, political and moral concerns.

Atthough there was no difference between the treatment and control groups in how electricity consumption changed across the two summers, in the PEPCO study there was a significant difference between conditions in consumption itself. This difference, and indeed the difference between the two groups in the CECO study, was sizable and existed in both the pretest and posttest periods. The fact that the treatment households tended to be the larger energy users may be part of the reason they asked to be put on the plan. Being on the plan would help smooth out the extra large bills for the peak use seasons of summer and, for electric space heating customers, winter. As for why they used more electricity, there are several possibilities. Perhaps a greater proportion of the treatment group houses were air conditioned, or they may have been larger. It is also possible that treatment group residents were more profligate in their energy using ways. There is no way of determining from utility company records which of these possibilities was the case.

In the future, as the practical advantages of average payment plans in terms of customer and utility company satisfaction become widely known, and as soaring fuel costs make the plans increasingly attractive to more and more customers, the automatic enrollment of customers in average payment plans may become widespread. In some places this is already beginning to happen on a limited basis. PEPCO, for example, automatically puts onto the plan new customers moving into electrically space-heated homes. (These customers do, however, have the right to switch back to the conventional "pay as you go" plan.) it may very well be, as in the case when customers choose to go on an average payment plan, that automatically enrolling customers has no effect on energy consumption. However, given the potential for increased consumption, if this supposition is not true, it would be wise to confirm it by empirical investigation. Unlike the present studies that employed a quasi-experimental design, studies of the effect of automatic enrollment or mandatory participation in average payment plans would have to use experimental designs. Hopefully, arguments can be found to allay the concerns of the utility companies over the random assignment of customers to payment plans.
